# Movie Genre Analysis ðŸŽ¬

## Overview
The "Movie Genre Analysis" project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the distribution of movie genres using a dataset sourced from IMDb. The goal is to leverage R programming to create insightful visualizations, such as pie charts and histograms, that reveal the popularity and distribution of different movie genres.

## Project Structure

- **Data Acquisition**: Collected IMDb data in CSV format and loaded it into R.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed the dataset by handling missing data, removing duplicates, and extracting relevant columns.
- **Data Exploration**: Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and key statistics.
- **Genre Categorization**: Grouped movies by genre to prepare for visualization.
- **Visualization**: Created pie charts and histograms to illustrate genre distribution and frequency.
- **Documentation**: Documented the code and summarized findings in a report.

## Technologies Used
- **R Programming**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: For creating pie charts and histograms.

## Visualizations
The project includes:
- **Pie Charts**: To show the proportional distribution of movie genres.
- **Histograms**: To provide a detailed analysis of genre frequency.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khantauheed27/movie-genre-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd movie-genre-analysis
   ```
3. **Open the R script**:
   - Use RStudio or any R-compatible IDE to open and run the script.
   - Make sure to install the necessary packages if not already installed:
     ```R
     install.packages("tidyverse")
     ```

4. **Run the analysis**:
   - Load the dataset and run the analysis to generate visualizations.

## Results
- **Pie charts and histograms** created during the project will help in understanding the distribution and popularity of movie genres within the IMDb dataset.
